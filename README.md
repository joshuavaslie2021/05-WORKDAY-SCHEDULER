## NW-HW-05-WORKDAY-PLANNER

## DESCRIPTION

Homework #5 in Northwestern's coding bootcamp asks us to contstruct a webpage that utilizes time-based javascript with moment.js to render a basic day planner. The planner updates on the hour to indicate what hours have passed, and stores appoints locally for the user to look back to.
